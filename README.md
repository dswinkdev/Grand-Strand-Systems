This repository showcases my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance, as part of the Computer Science program. The project files submitted here are from Project One and Project Two, demonstrating my ability to create unit tests, analyze different approaches to software testing, and design software based on user needs.

In this portfolio, you will find:

Project One Files: Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java

Project Two Files: Summary and reflections report

This README file reflects on my approach to software development, design, and testing, providing context for the work completed and insights into my learning journey.

1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code is both functional and secure, I focus on the following approaches:

Unit Testing: I write comprehensive unit tests to check the functionality of individual components. For instance, in Project One, I created tests for the ContactService class to verify that each method functions as expected.

Code Reviews: Code reviews help identify bugs, potential security vulnerabilities, and areas of improvement. This practice helps catch issues early and promotes collaboration.

Input Validation: To secure the software, I validate user input and ensure that data is properly sanitized to prevent attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

Secure Libraries and Tools: I also use trusted libraries and frameworks that follow best practices for security, ensuring that dependencies are up-to-date and vulnerabilities are patched.

Continuous Integration: Automated testing and integration with CI/CD pipelines help ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality and meet security standards.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program involves the following steps:

Requirements Gathering: I gather information through user stories, interviews, and questionnaires. This ensures I understand what the users need and what problems the software is supposed to solve.

Mockups and Prototypes: Before diving into code, I create wireframes or prototypes to visualize the user interface and functionality. These designs help the user clarify their expectations and provide feedback early in the process.

User-Centered Design: I follow user-centered design principles to ensure that the software is intuitive and meets the needs of the target audience. I incorporate feedback through regular testing with real users and adapt the program accordingly.

Iterative Development: I use an iterative approach where I release software in stages, gathering feedback at each stage and refining the program to better meet user needs.

3. How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software includes the following principles:

Modular Design: I design software in a modular way, breaking down complex features into smaller, manageable components. This makes the software easier to maintain, extend, and test. For example, in Project One, I separated the logic for managing contacts into different service classes.

Design Patterns: I use design patterns, such as the Singleton or Factory pattern, to address recurring design problems and make my code more flexible and maintainable.

Scalability and Performance: I ensure that my design can handle growth. This might involve using more efficient data structures, like binary search trees or hash tables, and considering future expansion of features.

SOLID Principles: I follow SOLID principles for object-oriented design to ensure my code is robust, flexible, and easy to extend without introducing defects.

Documentation: Throughout the design process, I create clear and concise documentation to explain how different components interact and what each part of the software is responsible for. This makes the software easier to understand for both current and future developers.
